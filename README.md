# Mapping Earthquakes
## Goals
The goal of this assignment was to use both JS and HTML to create an interactive map of both minor earthquakes with a magnitude of 3.9 or less and major earthquakes with a magnitude of 4.0 or more by using circle markers. The tectonic plates in the areas where the earthquakes occured was also shown. Based on the where the major earthquakes are located it seems like most of them happened between tectonic plates. This map can be used to determine which areas in the world are more prone to earthquakes and the magnitude of them.
