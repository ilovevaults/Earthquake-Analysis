# Mapping Earthquakes
## Overview
The purpose of this assignment was to map both minor earthquakes with a magnitude of 3.9 or less and major earthquakes with a magnitude of 4.0 or more by using circle markers. The tectonic plates in the areas where the earthquakes occured is also shown. Based on the where the major earthquakes are located it seems like most of them happen between tectonic plates.
